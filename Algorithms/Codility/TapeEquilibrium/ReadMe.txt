Actually i have think about negative numbers but i though there is no negative numbers.
I hasn't read the assumptions good enough since there is a statement that says:
each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000..1,000].
:( 
I can't solve the random problem. And also solution3 has %66 speed performance which is not good.

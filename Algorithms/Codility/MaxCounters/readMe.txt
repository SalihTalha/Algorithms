Problem was about time complexity.
I though some other way while i writing the code but it was hard and 
i know if i tried it i'll probably do something wrong and make it more complex.
My idea was looking for N+1's in array and if i find it, then i'll counting the
max repeating element in 0 to current iterator. It's much more efficient 
than this one in such extreme scenarios.

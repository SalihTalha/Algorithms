Sometimes you just have to use sorting algorithms. It will seem bad to use sort when you just
looking for one element but in a chaotic case, it is always an efficent way to solve problems.

Note:
	I have added solution 2 and it is devastating... I'm not going to solve algorithm questions
	in these hours after this time. It's 00:41am and i like to get up early generally.

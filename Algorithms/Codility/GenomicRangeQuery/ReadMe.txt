I have been waiting some performance issues but not that much. I think that was an easy question though i get 25 :D
I think the problem is as I understand from the test cases this algorithm is definitely slow and also it has some errors. 
Errors like when the solution comes from last or first char in that string part.
Whatever I'll be trying to make it better.

There says: 
For example, for the input ('TC', [0, 0, 1], [0, 1, 1]) the solution returned a wrong answer (got [4, 4, 2] expected [4, 2, 2]).
